# RLDDM

## Overview

`RLDDM` is an R package that provides a computational framework for modeling decision-making processes by combining reinforcement learning (RL) and the drift-diffusion model (DDM) using frequentist methods. Detailed information on the RLDDM framework can be found in [Pedersen et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1199-y) (for Bayesian methods) and [Bian et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1214/25-AOAS2112) (for frequentist methods).

## Installation
